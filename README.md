The Student Management System lets the admin of an organization handle student details such as their university or school roll numbers, phone numbers and even grades in various subjects and modify them. Students can access a different interface which can let them view their details.

The username and password grants access to the student management system, which is different for the admin and for students. The admin can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on each student's information. The interface was created using Java Swing.
